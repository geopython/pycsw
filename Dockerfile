FROM alpine:3.4

# There's bug in libxml2 v2.9.4 that prevents using an XMLParser with a schema
# file.
#
# https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766834
#
# It seems to have been fixed upstream, but the fix has not been released into
# a new libxml2 version. As a workaround, we are sticking with the previous
# version, which works fine.
# This means that we need to use alpine's archives for version 3.1, which are
# the ones that contain the previous version of libxml2
#
# Also, for some unkwnon reason, alpine 3.1 version of libxml2 depends on
# python2. We'd rather use python3 for pycsw, so we install it too.
