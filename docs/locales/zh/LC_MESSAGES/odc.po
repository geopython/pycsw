"Open Data Catalog (https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog/) is an "
"open data catalog based on Django, Python and PostgreSQL. It was "
"originally developed for OpenDataPhilly.org, a portal that provides "
"access to open data sets, applications, and APIs related to the "
"Philadelphia region. The Open Data Catalog is a generalized version of "
"the original source code with a simple skin. It is intended to display "
"information and links to publicly available data in an easily searchable "
"format. The code also includes options for data owners to submit data for"
" consideration and for registered public users to nominate a type of data"
" they would like to see openly available to the public."

"pycsw supports binding to an existing Open Data Catalog repository for "
"metadata query.  The binding is read-only (transactions are not in scope,"
" as Open Data Catalog manages repository metadata changes in the "
"application proper)."
