GitHub (Wiki, Issues, Code)
---------------------------

The pycsw `wiki`_ provides an area for supporting information that frequently changes and / or is outside the scope of the formal documentation.
 
pycsw's `issue tracker`_ is the place to report bugs or request enhancements.  To submit a `bug`_ be sure to specify the version you are using, the appropriate component, a description of how to reproduce the bug, as well as what version of Python and platform.  For convenience, you can run ``sbin/pycsw-admin.py -c get_sysprof`` and copy/paste the output into your bug report.

GitHub provides the ability for users to issue `pull requests`_, and is the preferred way to have your contributions added to pycsw, although patches and other mechanisms are welcome as well.  If you are submitting a patch, please add the ``has-patch`` label to the ticket (so tickets with patches can be easily filtered).  Also read the :ref:`faq` before submitting.

All pycsw `source code`_ is managed on GitHub, which includes the latest (``master``) and other supported branches.
