For convenience, you can run ``sbin/pycsw-admin.py -c get_sysprof`` and copy/paste the output into your bug report.  If you are submitting a patch, please enter the keywords ``has-patch`` in the ``Keywords`` field (so tickets with patches can be easily filtered). Also read the :ref:`faq` before submitting.
