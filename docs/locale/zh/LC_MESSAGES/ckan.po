"`ckanext-spatial`_ is CKAN's geospatial extension.  The extension adds a "
"spatial field to the default CKAN dataset schema, using PostGIS as the "
"backend. This allows to perform spatial queries and display the dataset "
"extent on the frontend. It also provides harvesters to import geospatial "
"metadata into CKAN from other sources, as well as commands to support the "
"CSW standard. Finally, it also includes plugins to preview spatial formats "
"such as GeoJSON."
