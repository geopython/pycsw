"OGC API - Records support exposes parent metadata as distinct "
"collections, reducing the barrier for users querying on a specific "
"collection, for multiple collections.  This functionality is implemented "
"by default and does not require additional setup/configuration by the "
"user.  More information on this feature can be found in `RFC 10: OGC API "
"- Records virtual collections support`_."
