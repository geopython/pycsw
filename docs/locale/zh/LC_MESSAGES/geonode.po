"GeoNode (http://geonode.org/) is a platform for the management and "
"publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature and stable open-"
"source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use interface "
"allowing users, with little training, to quickly and easily share data and "
"create interactive maps. GeoNode provides a cost-effective and scalable tool"
" for developing information management systems.  GeoNode uses CSW as a "
"cataloguing mechanism to query and present geospatial metadata."

"pycsw supports binding to an existing GeoNode repository for metadata query."
"  The binding is read-only (transactions are not in scope, as GeoNode "
"manages repository metadata changes in the application proper)."
