"pycsw has the ability to perform distributed searching against other CSW "
"servers.  Distributed searching is disabled by default; to enable, "
"``server.federatedcatalogues`` must be set.  A CSW client must issue a "
"GetRecords request with ``csw:DistributedSearch`` specified, along with an "
"optional ``hopCount`` attribute (see subclause 10.8.4.13 of the CSW "
"specification).  When enabled, pycsw will search all specified catalogues "
"and return a unified set of search results to the client.  Due to the "
"distributed nature of this functionality, requests will take extra time to "
"process compared to queries against the local repository."
