"Open Data Catalog (https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog/) is an open "
"data catalog based on Django, Python and PostgreSQL. It was originally "
"developed for OpenDataPhilly.org, a portal that provides access to open data"
" sets, applications, and APIs related to the Philadelphia region. The Open "
"Data Catalog is a generalized version of the original source code with a "
"simple skin. It is intended to display information and links to publicly "
"available data in an easily searchable format. The code also includes "
"options for data owners to submit data for consideration and for registered "
"public users to nominate a type of data they would like to see openly "
"available to the public."
