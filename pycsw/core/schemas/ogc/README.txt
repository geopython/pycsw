These schemas are shipped with pycsw to support realtime XML validation.

The schemas have been downloaded from the official OGC schema repository at http://schemas.opengis.net/

Note that only schemas required for pycsw are included.

As well, xs:import and xs:include statements with references to absolute URLs have been modified
to refer to relative URLs for performance.
