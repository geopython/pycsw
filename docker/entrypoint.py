"""Entrypoint script for docker containers.

This module serves as the entrypoint for docker containers. Its main
purpose is to set up the pycsw database so that newly generated
containers may be useful soon after being launched, without requiring
additional input.

    Main function of this entrypoint script. It will read pycsw's config file
    and handle the specified repository backend, after which it will yield
    control to the gunicorn wsgi server.

    The ``os.execlp`` function is used to launch gunicorn. This causes it to
    replace the current process - something analogous to bash's `exec`
    command, which seems to be a common techinque when writing docker
    entrypoint scripts. This means gunicorn will become PID 1 inside the
    container and it somehow simplifies the process of interacting with it
    (e.g. if the need arises to restart the worker processes). It also allows
    for a clean exit. See

    http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/signals.html

    for more information on how to control gunicorn by sending UNIX signals.
