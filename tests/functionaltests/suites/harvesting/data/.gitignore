# This file exists to force git to include this directory in the code
# repository.
#
# git does not include empty directories in code repositories.
#
# Functional tests are automatically generated by py.test. The way that the
# tests are set up, the presence of a ``data/`` directory inside a test suite
# has the following meaning:
#
# * if a ``data/`` directory does not exist, the tests of the suite use data
#   from the CITE suite;
#
# * if an empty ``data/`` directory exists, then a new empty database is 
#   created and used;
#
# * if the ``data/`` directory exists and has files inside, a new database is
#   created and the files are loaded into the database as records.
#
# As such, the current suite needs an empty ``data/`` directory because its
# functional tests depend on the existence of an empty database.


# ignore all files in this directory (in case some file is put here by mistake,
# we do not want it to be sent to the git repository and mess up the functional
# tests)
*

# however, be sure to not ignore this file, as we need at least one file inside
# this directory, so that git will aknowledge its existence
