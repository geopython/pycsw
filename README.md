[pycsw](https://pycsw.org) is an OGC API - Records and CSW server implementation written in Python.

pycsw fully implements the the [OGC API - Records (OARec) standard](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records/)
and the OpenGIS Catalogue Service Implementation Specification (Catalogue Service for
the Web). Initial development started in 2010 (more formally announced in
2011). The project is certified OGC Compliant, and is an OGC Reference
Implementation.  Since 2015, pycsw is an official OSGeo Project.

pycsw allows for the publishing and discovery of geospatial metadata via
numerous APIs (OGC API - Records, CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, SRU). Existing
repositories of geospatial metadata can also be exposed, providing a standards-based
metadata and catalogue component of spatial data infrastructures.

pycsw is Open Source, released under an MIT license, and runs on all major
platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
